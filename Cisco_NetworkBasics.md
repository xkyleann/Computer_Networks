### 1.1.3 Who Owns "The Internet"?
* The internet is worlwide collection of interconnected networks, cooperatinf with each other to exchange information using
common standarts.
* Everything that you access online is located somewhere on the global internet. Social media sites, multiplayer games,
messaginh centers that provide email - all these internet destinations are connected to the local networks that send and receive information 
through internet. 
  * Online gaming connects thousands of people seamlessly.
  * Video conferencing instantly connects people around globe.
  * Phones connect globally to share voice, text and images.

### 1.2.1 Data Transmission | Types of Personal Data
#### What is Data? 
* Data is information that you input.
* Everytime you hit send or share or upload you are sending data that you created somewhere out onto the network.
* They are different types of data:
  * **_Volunteer Data_** --> Data that you offer yourself, you realize the data is being collected about you, and you are 
    agreeing to share it or store it somewhere on the network.
  * **_Inferred Data_** --> Data that you generate by your activities. Such as your credit card. Every place that you put your credit card it keeps record, and therefore, if you move about and go different stores, all informations are collected, in the places that you typically eat or shop.
  * **_Observed Data_** --> For example, your phone probably keeps,track your location. That information is also stored.

### 1.3 Bandwidth and Throughput [measurements]
* Streaming a movie or playing a multiplayer game requires reliable, fast connections. To support these "high bandwidth" applications, networks have to be capable of transmitting and receiving bits at very high rate.
* Different physical media support the transfer of bits at different speeds. **_The rate of data transfer is usually discussed in the terms of bandwidth and throughput._**
#### 1.3.1 Bandwidth 
* **Bandwidht** _is the capacity of medium to carry data_ . !!!!!!!!!!!!
* It is typicallt measured in the number of bits that can be sent accross the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurment are:
    * Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
    * Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
    * Billions of bits per second (Gbps)
* Speedtest --> Downloading Messages (millions,megabits per sec)
* Speedtest --> Upload Speed --> 35.04 Mbps
* **_Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that can be sent across the media in a second._**
#### 1.3.2 Throughput
* **_Throughout_** is the measure of the transfer of bit across the media over a given period of time.
* Many factors influence throughput including:
    * The amount of data being sent and received over the connection.
    * The amount of data, type of data, and latency of the network combine to cause throughput.
